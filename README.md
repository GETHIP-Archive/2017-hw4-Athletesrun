# Homework #4

This week you will be creating a Meteor app without a tutorial. We will leave the type of app up to you with a few requirements. One idea would be to create a profile page for yourself, pulling your data from MongoDB.

## Requirements

You must include:
 - 2 collections
 - 2 schemas
 - At least 3 different routes (Probably a home page and two other pages).
